Blockchain-Based Voting System with Integrated IoT Sensor Validation

This project demonstrates a decentralized, tamper-proof electronic voting system built on blockchain technology, with real-time IoT-based sensor integration for identity/authenticity validation. It is designed to enhance trust, transparency, and accessibility in modern democratic processes, especially for remote or high-risk zones.

The IoT sensors can include:

Biometric scanners (fingerprint, retina)

RFID/NFC tags for voter card verification

Environmental sensors to ensure secure physical voting environments

Votes are recorded immutably on a private Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

🛠️ Features:
✅ Secure voter registration

✅ Biometric/IoT sensor validation before voting

✅ Immutable vote recording using Ethereum smart contracts

✅ Transparent vote tallying

✅ Node.js + Web3 + Solidity integration

✅ Simulated IoT device integration via Python/Node (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
